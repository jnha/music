md"With a period of one second the sound is still noise.
You may be able to hear artifacts at regular intervals.
I've tried listening after regenerating the white noise
and it can be easier or harder to pick out the repetition
depending on the particular sound generated. 

What about shorter periods?
The repetitions will become faster and more noticable.
At around 30hz it will start to have an audible pitch.
At higher frequencies the pulses smooth out into a buzzy noise with a definite pitch. 
At periods of low hundreds of frames the frequency graph shows clearly
the lines of the individual harmonics.
First at the frequency of the repetition,
and with overtones at integer multiples of that frequency."

md"There is no fall off in harmonics,
their amplitude seems randomly distributed arround a flat value.
I was suprised to see how clean the spectrum is
despite using white noise as the base of the sound. 
This demonstrates how the harmonic series is a fundamental feature of sounds that repeat at regular intervals."

md"# Odd harmonics with periodic noise
We can remove the even harmonics by making the second half of the waveform
the same as the first half but flipped upside down, call this an odd sound for short. Every even partial is an even repetition, so it splits into two equal parts on the first and second halves of the waveform. To be equal to its own negative on the second half an even partial has to be $0$. Every odd partial reaches the midpoint of the waveform halfway through its own period, and so the second half is the first half offset in phase by half a period. But $\text{sin}(x+\pi) = -\text{sin}(x)$ and so odd harmonics always give odd sounds.
Since a periodic sound is the sum of its even and odd partials
and the odd partials already give an odd sound,
a sound is odd whenever the sum of its even partials are also odd,
but that only happens when the even partials are $0$.

This becomes very useful when imitating natural instruments that only contain odd harmonics, like many wind instruments."
