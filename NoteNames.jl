# Just intonation definitions for note names in extended pythagorean tuning.
# Using A = 440 tuning standard, then all other notes are tuned by 5ths to that A
# All notes are turned to their 4th octave frequencies (i.e. C is middle C)
# Other octaves can be reached by multiplying or dividing by 2
A = 440
# Down circle of 5ths
